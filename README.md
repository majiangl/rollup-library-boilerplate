# rollup-library-boilerplate
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It can produce much smaller size of code than [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), especially in large projects.
